# misha-scripts

Misha Ramendik (mramendi) uses this repository to share useful scripts, generally for mangling Asciidoc documentation.

These scripts have no warranty, use at your own risk.

The documentation for every script, such as it is, is in comments at the start of the script. You might need to change some presets in the scripts, the presets are right below the documentation.
